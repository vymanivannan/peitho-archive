        <p class="epigraph" style="text-align: right;">Content note: anti-Tamil pogroms, displacement, immigration</p>	
        <p class="pt-3">Even though her husband Kannan tells her to <i>just use the calling cards, what else are they there for</i>, Valli prefers to write aerograms, a more affordable option in the 1980s. When she immigrated to be with Kannan during his doctoral study, she didn't anticipate never returning home due to an escalation in violence. Back home, she was wealthy, but here they're unable to pay off their credit card debts. She justifies aerograms as cost-saving because she feels ashamed of her thirst for Tamil handwriting from home. After her daughter learns to write, Valli is excited to bring the girl into her epistolary practice but is unprepared for her reluctance. She has to threaten her into writing a canned English postscript. Valli pretends her daughter's protests don’t pain her, telling herself, <i>What does this little girl know?</i> Valli herself does not know that the tactile indentations of her relatives' handwriting &mdash; easily felt through the thin blue paper, postmarked Batticaloa &mdash; are the closest thing she will have to their embrace for the next thirty years. Or that she will have stopped writing home by the time her daughter finally expresses curiosity, and during a lonely, frustrated spring cleaning, perversely thrown all her aerograms away.</p>
