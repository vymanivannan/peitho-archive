              <p class="epigraph" style="text-align: right;">Content note: genocide, gun violence</p>
                <p class="pt-3">A self-taught cook, Valli prepares the best <span lang="ta">appam</span> on Long Island. <span lang="ta">Appam</span>, which the English call <i>hoppers</i>, is a breakfast food, but because of high demand from family and friends, she batch cooks all day and serves them at night in all-you-can-eat dinners, stopping only when her guests are full. She didn't know how to cook when she left Sri Lanka, but her <span lang="ta">Amma</span> still gave her an old aluminum <span lang="ta">அப்ப சட்டி (appachatti)</span> &mdash; the little wok in which <span lang="ta">appam</span> are fried &mdash; to take with her. <span lang="ta">Amma</span> is fond of saying that the history of the cooking pot also makes the food. This <span lang="ta">appachatti</span> passed through three generations of women before emigrating with Valli. When Black July complicated the possibility of return, Valli taught herself to cook Tamil food, attempting to replicate gustatory sense memories of home. It takes many hours of laboring over the unfamiliar gas range, experimenting with temperatures and timing, culinary ratios, spice blends, Western subtitutions for unavailable ingredients, like Mexican brown cane sugar for jaggery. Flour grinding, blending, overnight fermentation, a few drops of vegetable oil to ensure the batter doesn't stick to the <span lang="ta">appachatti</span>, then hours of standing, frying, plating the <span lang="ta">appam</span> before its lacy edges burn. Her family loves <span lang="ta">appam</span> day, her oldest daughter consuming as many as 13 in one sitting, but from-scratch cooking takes a physical toll. Valli's body aches all the time. When it isn't in use, her daughters steal the <span lang="ta">appachatti</span> from the cabinet, wear it like a pretend helmet, army crawl on the carpet, strike the tin with a pencil to produce the <i>rat-a-tat-tat</i> of pretend gunfire. In reality, a shooting is one sharp crack at the gate, retreating footsteps, and a dead uncle weakly pulsing blood and brain onto the veranda you washed that morning. This Eelam Tamil <span lang="ta">appachatti</span> has witnessed real violence, but where did these American-born girls learn to play war? When her daughter moves out and finally wants to know, <i>How long do you ferment the batter? How much cream of rice to use?</i>, Valli doesn't say how years of batch cooking <span lang="ta">appam</span> left her with pain and scars. She prefers to share the culinary advice her own <span lang="ta">Amma</span> gave her over the telephone: <i>How should I know? As long and as much as you need.</i></p>
